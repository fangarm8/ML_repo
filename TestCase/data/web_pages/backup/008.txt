[Hoyt Chair]PRODUCT


























Description
Designed with simplicity in mind, the [Hoyt Chair]PRODUCT is anything but basic. Keep conversations flowing by placing a pair of these chairs in a room. The square silhouette and smart lines look even better when two chairs sit together. Plush cushions, and padded bolsters (which are stitched in place to keep the arms looking crisp and comfortable) make this chair the perfect place to chat or just relax.
Specifications

We worry about the details of your furniture so you don't have to.

Frame: Kiln-dried hardwood frame (never particle board or pine).
Joints: Corner-blocked, high-pressure stapled, and glued (screwed and doweled frames also available).
Suspension: Unidirectional webbing (interwoven strips of nylon webbing that create a very stable platform for cushions).
Cushions: Medium HR polyurethane foam. No flame retardants.
Glue: Low-VOC
38" L x 36" D x 34" H
Makes a great swivel chair. Call or email for details.

        Shipping & Returns
      











How long does shipping and delivery take?
In the Portland metro area, our lead time is 12 to 14 weeks. For the rest of the continental United States, lead times will include 2 to 4 additional weeks for shipping. 
Due to current supply chain challenges, please note that the lead time(s) provided at the time of sale are a representation of our understanding, in the moment, of the furniture or component part’s future availability. Lead times are subject to change and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. We will keep you advised of any delays that arise as the information is received.
Can I pick my furniture up?
We offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as "in good condition" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released.
What if my furniture doesn't fit?
The customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited. Additional shipping and delivery charges will apply to orders that use store credit.
