The Ro Easy Chair was designed by Spanish designer Jaime Hayon, and is a very comfortable new style of chair by the Danish brand Fritz Hansen. This wingback chair is perfect for relaxing in, thanks to its high back and soft upholstery. The Ro armchair is made with excellent craftsmanship and out of sustainable materials. The design of the Ro chair is elegant and suited for a classical, contemporary or modern home. A matching foot stool is also available with this chair.

 The armchair comes in a great choice of fabrics and colours, and is also available in a "Designer Selections" version in a mix of two fabrics for the shell and the cushions. The legs are made of brushed aluminium or solid wood.
