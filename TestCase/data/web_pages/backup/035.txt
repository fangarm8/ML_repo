ECO-FRIENDLYWith a focus on qualityfurniture that can pass down tothe next generation, we ensure itdoes not end up in a landfill.
















Pride in Bench-Built CraftsmanshipOur painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture. Every chair, bed, and dresser—each is built one at a time start to finish at a single workbench by a single craftsman who has complete ownership and pride in the finished result. Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish. 

Read More About Our QUality

















Why We ShineThe sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.
