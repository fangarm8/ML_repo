Original Stag sideboard Primed and painted in Farrow & Ball, Down pipe. All 5 handles are original brass which I have restored to give a black modern effect. The main feature on this piece is a large Stag head drawer pull looking very proud to be there. Each drawer has been lined with a luxury geometric grey and copper design. 
A wonderful solid piece that has been given a modern twist. 
 
Dimensions: 
Width-131cm
Height-71cm
Depth-46.5cm 
 


REMEMBER:
Please remember that with all up cycled furniture, you will come across the odd chip, dink or imperfection due to being old. Any major repairs or obvious dents are worked on before the final finish. Character is key as well as perfectly painted furniture.
