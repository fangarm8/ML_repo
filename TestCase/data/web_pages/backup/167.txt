These Mexican style hammocks are made from hundreds of cotton strings that are woven together to give you a soft bed that feels as though you are floating on air.Despite their delicate appearance, a Mayan type hammock like this is extremely stretchy and strong - this size is a technically a single size but it will fit two adults and it is wide enough to lie totally across it (instead of lengthways). With a little bit of care, they should last for years of happy swinging.
A Mexican hammock is a stunning addition to any home, indoors or in the garden. It can be hung on trees, posts, pergolas, hooks in the walls and stands, to name but a few...
