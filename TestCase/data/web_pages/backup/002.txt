 Handmade by Beadlight in the UK, the Cirrus collection was originally designed for use in private jet aircraft, and first and business class cabins. The range has proved incredibly successful in hotels, private residences and mega yachts. Built to the exacting standards demanded by the aeropsace industry, each Beadlight reading light is made by hand and wrapped in English leather with hand stitching.   
- Ideal as a bedhead light, the luxurious fitting provides two brightness settings for reading. 
- Can be mounted to existing walls and bed heads.
- Simple installation is required by an electrician.
- Energy Efficient. These LED lights become the perfect solution to make substantial energy savings.
- The wall lights use 1.4 watts of energy and require a 12v transformer, not included.
- Previously available only to architects and interior designers, the Beadlight collection is now available to the public exclusively through Dunlin.
