      How soon will it ship?






How quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time)
At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders.  Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana.  Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others.  We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.
Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range.  These lead times are APPROXIMATE, they are NOT EXACT.  Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers.  These situations are beyond our control.  By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our best estimate.  When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.
Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix.For example, item FD-3051T has an "FD-" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.
If your delivery location is outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, if the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.

We're here to help.  Call 480-962-9930 and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner.  A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge.





      Shipping information






Good news!  We now offer nation-wide delivery for most products (we have shipped all over the U.S.  We do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!).  We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S. - some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area.
The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location.  Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote.
Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.
Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled. Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.
With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable.
If the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.
White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona):
White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area.  To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote.  This delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and putting them in the first dry area or depending on the shipper for your area, into the room of choice (1st floor only).  If your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance because some shippers will not do stairs. Stairs or elevators may or may not require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is.  If you order a platform bed, White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed.  Please note that White Glove Style Blanket Wrap delivery does NOT include attaching or reversing hardware or installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming.  This is a one or two person delivery.  An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition.
Basic delivery (within Arizona only):
Basic delivery covers areas within Arizona only.  Basic delivery within Arizona starts at $95 and goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area.  Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs. This is usually a one-person delivery - the customer may be asked to assist the driver.  The item may come blanket-wrapped or in a carton, depending on the builder.  This delivery does not include unpacking, debris removal, assembly, nor set up. For delivery upstairs or downstairs or if you need set-up, please contact our store at 480-962-9930 to ask for those delivery/set-up costs.  An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition.
