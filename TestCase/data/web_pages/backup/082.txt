About

At Scanteak, we seek to create beautifully designed and lasting furniture. Our design and craft are inspired by Scandinavian ideology, whereby simplicity and functionality take precedence. Scanteak’s lifelong vision lies in furnishing home solutions to the hectic pace of executive living. We also believe that the colour and grains of teak, which exude natural beauty, coupled with simple and uncluttered designs, are a perfect mix for the executive’s home.
