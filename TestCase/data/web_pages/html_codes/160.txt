This bed is a masterpiece ,you will Sleep like a Queen literally. My bedroom is simply gorgeous! By Madisen Bruen on Oct 10, 2020 We selected the whole set to redo our bedroom. The bed is beautiful and quite impressive and looks really nice in our room. WE LOVE IT By Jensen Murray III on Oct 31, 2022 Absolutely beautiful in person! The quality is great! I am still remodeling the bedroom and as soon as this project is completed, i will post. By Osbaldo Gibson on Feb 18, 2021 This is the best bed purchased I made so far! The bed is extremely beautiful and well made. It took 3 men to carry it upstairs because of its weight. Once it was installed, it transformed the room. With a 1700 puffy mattress on it, this bed becomes heaven on earth! Definitely recommend! By Bailee Quigley MD on Jan 3, 2023 We love this bed. It’s gorgeous. The first time, the headboard came cracked. We donated  to a family in need. A replacement was sent immediately. It’s very heavy and large. You will need two men to put together and carry it to the bedroom.We purchase the ivory color and looks amazing Similar Panel Bed Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Beige Velvet & Brushed Brass King Size Bed by VIG Modrest Eldora $2,741.46 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Beige Velvet & Brushed Brass Queen Size Panel Bed by VIG Modrest Moontide $2,851.12 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Beige Velvet & Brushed Brass King Size Panel Bed by VIG Modrest Moontide $3,147.84 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (5) Modern Beige Velvet & Gold Eastern King Bed by VIG Divani Casa Visalia $1,901.98 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Brown Upholstered Panel Queen Bed Milo 1149-105 Bernards Modern $1,113.00 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (3) Doline Ivory King Tufted Upholstered Bed Classic $2,561.48 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Black Velvet Tufted Full Bed SOPHIA Galaxy Home Modern Contemporary Modern $1,300.59 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Gray Velvet Crystal Tufted King Bed SOPHIA Galaxy Home Modern Contemporary $1,440.60 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Gray Solid Wood Queen Bed Faith Galaxy Home Transitional $1,498.50 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Navy Velvet Queen Bed KIRA KiraNavy-Q Meridian Modern Contemporary $1,162.00 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Cream Velvet King Bed FRITZ FritzCream-K Meridian Modern Contemporary $1,302.00 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites Black Velvet Queen Bed FRITZ FritzBlack-Q Meridian Modern Contemporary $1,232.00 Choose other Acme Furniture Panel Bed Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (5) Beige Fabric & Antique Taupe Queen Bed 26050Q Chelmsford Acme Classic $1,730.41 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (3) Transitional Charcoal/Gray Finish Fabric King Bed Carine II-26257EK Acme $1,125.59 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (4) Tufted Pearl White & Gold Patina King Bed Dresden II-27817EK Acme Traditional $2,660.20 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (3) Antique Platinum Queen Bed Versailles 26860Q Acme Vintage Classic $2,923.85 Saved to my favorites Removed from my favorites (5) Beige Fabric & Antique Taupe King Bed 26047EK Chelmsford Acme Classic $1,783.00 + VIEW ALL KEEP IN TOUCH Subscribe Info Shipping Returns Payment Customer Care Our Company About Us Blog Details Condition Of Use Privacy Policy Financing Warranty Customer care Call us1-877-390-1797 Contact us Work schedule Customer Service M-F 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM Sales Assistance 7:00 AM - 6:00 PM Copyright © 2004-2024 NY Furniture Outlets, Inc.
