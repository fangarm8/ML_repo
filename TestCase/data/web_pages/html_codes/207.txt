Once orders have been received into our warehouse we will arrange final delivery with you.

Delivery Partners We use Royal Mail, UPS or APC to deliver accessories, small furniture & lighting. Delivery is Monday to Friday, we will notify you once the item has been sent and provide tracking details where applicable. For large furniture orders such as sofas, we use a specialist furniture home delivery team, who are experts in handling furniture to make sure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible. This service is a 'white glove' service and includes the following: Confirmation of your two-hour delivery window the working day before your agreed delivery date An estimated time of arrival on the day of delivery (this is a guide not a guarantee due to traffic and possible difficulties in earlier deliveries which are out of our control) Two man delivery team Unpack and position the furniture in the room of your choice Remove and recycle packaging We ask that you check the dimensions at the delivery address for access (including doors, corridors and stairs) as well as the area of intended use, before you order to ensure that the product is the right size for you and to enable us to deliver your order successfully.  You must provide a clear route to the room of choice removing any obstacles from the exterior and communal areas.  Goods that fail to fit into your property at the point of delivery are your responsibility as we have no control over this.  Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery. Access Checks If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service.  For an additional fee a trained member of our team will visit your home to measure up, giving you piece of mind before you buy.  Get in touch to find out pricing and further details. Removal of existing furniture As part of the white glove service we can also remove your old furniture for an extra fee, which must be arranged with us prior to delivery.  We reserve the right to refuse collection of unhygienic furniture for health and safety reasons.  Please get in touch to find out further details. RETURNS We offer a no quibble returns policy* - so you are fully entitled to a refund within 14 working days of delivery. *except for the products described below referred to as made-to-order or those in our Outlet/Clearance collection. Please get in touch with us if you wish to return an item and we will advise how best to proceed hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk | 020 8305 7265. We ask that the product you return is in new, unused, condition with all the original packaging and product tags still attached.  For small accessory items being returned by post or courier, we advise you use an insured, signed for service in case the parcel fails to reach us.  Unfortunately we cannot cover the cost of return postage, unless the item is faulty.

Products, which fall into the following categories, will not be refunded unless they are proven to be faulty; Any goods made to order or not normally kept in stock at Someday Designs (see more information below) Self assembly furniture cannot be returned once assembly is part or fully completed Made-to-order products Due to the bespoke nature of the products we supply and the diverse choice of finishes and materials, goods are often made-to-order by our design partners and imported from overseas.  Therefore it is not possible to return these items. We will contact you via email to confirm your made-to-order details to ensure all specifications are completely correct before we place the order with the supplier. Following delivery, made-to-order goods are non-returnable unless we have not supplied the correct item or specification as per the order confirmation email.
