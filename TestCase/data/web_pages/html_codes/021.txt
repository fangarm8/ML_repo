More information View images Facebook Pinterest Twitter Leg Finish Options How Our Armchairs Are Made We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.​ Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. For patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.
