Post Share Pin it Shipping & Returns How long does shipping and delivery take? In the Portland metro area, our lead time is 12 to 14 weeks. For the rest of the continental United States, lead times will include 2 to 4 additional weeks for shipping. Due to current supply chain challenges, please note that the lead time(s) provided at the time of sale are a representation of our understanding, in the moment, of the furniture or component part’s future availability. Lead times are subject to change and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. We will keep you advised of any delays that arise as the information is received. Can I pick my furniture up? We offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as \"in good condition\" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released. What if my furniture doesn't fit? The customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited. Additional shipping and delivery charges will apply to orders that use store credit.

Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub\/tile\/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable. Simplicity and Style Designed for durability, practicality and style.

Dimensions Metric Imperial Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Millimetres: 1260w × 700d × 830h (730 desk height) Inches: 49.61w × 27.56d × 32.68h (28.74 desk height) Materials and finishes Black American walnut Black walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. European oak European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage. Dark brown house leather Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. Care guide Oiled wood An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. • Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. • To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment \/ more stubborn stains: • As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: • Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) • Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. Lacquered wood A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: • Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. • Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. House leather Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. Care guide Oiled wood An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture. • Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible. • To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out. 6 monthly replenishment \/ more stubborn stains: • As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces Do not: • Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left) • Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain. Lacquered wood A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills. Day to day cleaning: • Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth. Do not: • Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. • Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer. House leather Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely. Day to day cleaning: • As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner. Do not: • Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

A Vast Icon, the Samson Daybed is a simple design, beautifully executed. Crafted from solid mango hardwood, and hand finished with 4 coats of hard wearing NC lacquer, this daybed is designed to last for decades. While we sell many of these for inside use, it is also perfectly suited for a covered veranda. Click + Collect Click + Collect Flat Rate Delivery Flat Rate Delivery Ways to Pay Ways to Pay Key Features - Mango Timber The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component. This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this \"working with the grain\". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations! Country of Origin: India Product Care - Timber Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below: Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth; Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent  scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately; To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months. Only use natural wax, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer. Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating\/cooling vents. Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur. Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.

More information View images Facebook Pinterest Twitter Leg Finish Options How Our Armchairs Are Made We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back. Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.​ Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard. Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard. All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate. The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know. Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description. For patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.

It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA. This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

We do not view these marks as defects. Please note that hue and color varies between hides. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each chair. Finish samples available upon request. +  Orders of 3 or more stools may require a freight shipment.  Please inquire with any questions regarding freight deliveries. CARE + We recommend using a microfiber dust cloth to care for wood pieces. Kindly avoid additional cleaners and products. +  Please care for your leather products with a soft cloth and leather cleaner.

ECO-FRIENDLYWith a focus on qualityfurniture that can pass down tothe next generation, we ensure itdoes not end up in a landfill. Pride in Bench-Built CraftsmanshipOur painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture. Every chair, bed, and dresser—each is built one at a time start to finish at a single workbench by a single craftsman who has complete ownership and pride in the finished result. Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish. Read More About Our QUality Why We ShineThe sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.

See more Also available in Our signature solid teak bench is exclusive to Living by Design in Australia, as featured on the front cover of Country Style Magazine and in House and Garden editorials. A perfect blend of modern country, meets simple nordic functionality. The clean solid lines complement the organic natural curve of the seat, ensuring no two are the same. The hardwood teak is very lightly oiled and sustainably sourced. While the wood is of superior quality, teak naturally allows for knots or slight discolouration. Our design partners hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top according to Living by Design's specifications. Each of our teak tops vary in this process, and we do not consider these variations to be faults. An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our extensive size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces... indoor or outdoor.

Give them the gift of choice with a The Banyan Tree Furniture gift card. Gift cards are delivered by email and contain instructions to redeem them at checkout. Our gift cards have no additional processing fees. Shipping & Lead Times The Banyan Tree requires a street address for all deliveries, unfortunately we do not deliver to PO boxes. Deliveries are ONLY door to door and not brought into the premise unless stated otherwise. Please note that rubbish removal, assembly, placement or unpacking of goods are not included in your shipping quote unless stated otherwise. Contactless Click & Collect ﻿available in our Camberwell Showroom (Victoria) for ALL items, free. Free Delivery for specific collections only, such as Ethnicraft. Flat Rates: We offer the following flat shipping rates: $15 for all homewares and smaller items, $70 for all framed prints, canvases, mirrors and larger pieces PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR FULL PRICE ITEMS ONLY. For sale items, we will contact you directly and provide a quote at competitive prices, however this only applies to metro areas within Australia. We want to ensure your goods arrive safely and with the least chance of damage, so in most cases we will use specialised furniture couriers which may come at a higher price. If for any reason you cannot be present to accept delivery or if you wish for goods to be left in a safe place unattended, you must clearly make note of this when placing your order. Note: Authority to leave goods unattended will void all transit insurance claims. The Banyan Tree is not liable for theft, damages or loss resulting from your goods being left unattended. *In the occurrence of a faulty item please report it to us within 48 hours of receiving the item. Pick up from our Camberwell Showroom is always an option, and it’s free! Customer pickups on large pieces are done so at the bearer's responsibility and damage claims will not be accepted. Lead times can vary depending on the item, from as little as 1 week or as long as 16 weeks depending on manufacturing and shipping times. An order confirmation will be sent to your email immediately after you place your order, and you will be further advised within 2-5 business days on an estimated time of arrival for your item(s). We will strive to deliver your items within the specified timeframe, however please note that lead times are an estimate only and they may change due to circumstances beyond our control. SOLID TIMBER DISCLAIMER Product images are for illustration purposes only and may differ from the actual product. You should expect colour, grain and other natural imperfections and variations on natural timber pieces, which is what gives them a unique charm. These will not  be considered damaged pieces. It is not possible to request a certain colour as all pieces come in their own individual colour and finish. No two pieces will ever be the same. With solid timber pieces, we can never guarantee 100% that split\/cracks will not occur. Oak Care & Maintenance - Teak Care & Maintenance RETURNS POLICY We hope you love your Banyan Tree purchase, however, we understand if you change your mind when it arrives or if the piece doesn't quite fit as you hoped!

Returned items must be in their original packaging and condition, with all hardware, fixtures and accessories, and must not be used or altered in any way. Unfortunately, there is no refund, exchange, or cancellation available on custom, made to order and special order items.

This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.INDOOR USEGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.OUTDOOR USEGloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.Collections Using Teak180AccessoriesArchiBayBellsBlockBlowBoraCarverCosoCradleDeckFernGridGrid CabanaHavenKashaKayLightingLimaMayaMistralNavigatorOmadaRawSaranacSepalSwayWhirlWilliamZenithFollow usGloster Furniture GmbHTel: +49 4131 28753-0 CONTACT GLOSTER Your region: Rest of WorldPRIVACY STATEMENTABOUT COOKIESIMPRINT"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2024-10-04T17:30:56.540206Z","updated_at":"2024-10-05T12:18:04.168987Z","inner_id":74,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":75,"annotations":[{"id":104,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":0,"end":19,"text":"Wooden Coffee Table","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"j7OpCHWIed","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":5628,"end":5647,"text":"Wooden Coffee Table","labels":["PRODUCT"]},"id":"mI46nq0q-O","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2024-10-05T12:20:11.427438Z","updated_at":"2024-10-05T12:20:11.427460Z","draft_created_at":"2024-10-05T12:19:22.681929Z","lead_time":125.615,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"bad37bbc-e720-4db8-895e-c4175e32cac0","last_action":null,"task":75,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"64468792-073.txt","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"text":"Wooden Coffee Table – Laura James Skip to content Shop Indoor New In Shop Garden New In Shop Indoor New In Shop Garden New In Search New In Dining Room Dining Room SHOP AMELIA Dining Tables Dining Table Sets Dining Chairs Bar Stools Sideboards Storage Cabinets Console Tables Radiator Covers Clocks Shop All Dining Room More Categories Table Type Table Type 4 -

Pony has a moulded foam body, feet and ears which are all connected by a tube frame and upholstered in a stretch fabric. Pony chair was designed in 1973 by Eero Aarnio. We are happy to provide you fabric samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Pony. You can find our contact information here. Product details  Dimensions: 110 cm width x 65 cm depth x 87 cm heightMaterials: Metal, moulded foam, fabric Product Sheet Care Instructions 3D-files “A chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair...”  “A chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child’s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.” The Story of Pony In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunmäki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn’t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony… He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse. In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio’s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family’s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn’t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white. From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their ‘furs’. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg. Eero Aarnio’s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child’s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. “We are all big kids, of course”, says Eero Aarnio. Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero’s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive… More designs Unioninkatu 26, 00130 HelsinkiMon-Wed 10-16.00+358 40 559 0089 Eero's Story Shop The Archive Eero's Story Terms of Service Refund policy Footer Contact Contact Shipping & Returns Wholesale & Projects Retailers Footer Legal Privacy Policy Terms of Service Q&A Subscribe to our newsletter Language English English Suomi Language English Suomi © 2024 Eero Aarnio Originals.
